<h2> Contest overview and Basic Rules </h2>

<p>The rules are simple: the participants compete on finding information on the
web, by using their search skills, general knowledge, and quick thinking. An
interface to a major web-search engine is provided, which should be used for
all searching.  

<p>A game consists of 10-20 questions, with a specified time limit  either for
the whole game or for each question. For each correct answer you get 1
point. The answer must consist of two parts: 

<ul>
  <li>The <b>answer</b> text (usually a few words only)
  <li>One or more links to the <b>supporting pages</b> that should
explicitly contain this information.
</ul>

<p>An answer is considered correct if there is a web page containing your
answer, and you provided its URL. 

<p>An answer is considered incorrect if:
<ul>
  <li>One of the fields above is missing
  <li>The provided page does not contain the answer
  <li>The answer is too vague or does not address the question directly
  <li>The web page is manipulated by the participant (manually or
automatically), to contain the answer.
  <li>The answer was not found through our search interface (logs will
be checked to confirm that our interface was used).
</ul>

<p>The answer correctness will be checked by multiple human judges, with final
arbitration reserved by the contest organizers.

<h2> Who is organizing this and why </h2>

<p>This contest is organized by the Emory University's IR Lab. The goal of this
contest is to better understand how users search on the web for information
of varying difficulty, which strategies are more successful than others, and
how we could better help people find information on the web. To accomplish
this, our contest interface will track the search queries issued, the
documents clicked the amount of time a search takes, and other variables.
The resulting data, not associated with any identifiable information about
each player, may be shared with other IR researchers for scientific use. 

<h2>Contact information and fine print</h2>
